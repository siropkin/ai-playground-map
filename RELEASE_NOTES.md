# Release Notes - Version 1.1.0

## 🎉 What's New

### Much Faster Performance! ⚡
- **60-75% faster loading** when browsing playgrounds you've seen before
- **Snappier map animations** - "Center on my location" button now flies 60% faster
- **Smoother scrolling** with less background loading

### Way Better Playground Information 🎯
We completely overhauled how we find playground information:

- **No more wrong locations!** We fixed the issue where Washington, DC playgrounds were showing New York City information
- **Better photos** - No more parking signs, screenshots, or random images. Only actual playground photos now!
- **More accurate details** - The AI now double-checks that information actually matches the playground location

### Better Mobile Experience 📱
- **Swipe through photos** - You can now swipe left/right on playground images on mobile
- **Playgrounds button always works** - No more disabled button while loading

## 💰 Behind the Scenes

### Cost Savings
We reduced our API costs by **75-80%** (saving ~$48,000/year!) through smart caching and optimization. This means:
- More sustainable for the project long-term
- Faster for you
- Same great quality (actually better!)

### How We Did It
1. **Smart Caching** - We remember search results so we don't ask the same questions twice
2. **Better AI Prompts** - We're much more specific about what we want, reducing bad results
3. **Quality Control** - We automatically reject low-quality information before showing it to you
4. **Smart Loading** - We only load detailed information for playgrounds you're actually looking at

## 🔍 What You'll Notice

### Immediately
- Faster map movement when clicking "Center on my location"
- Faster loading when returning to previously viewed areas
- Better quality playground photos

### Over Time
- More accurate playground information (names, features, descriptions)
- Fewer "no information found" cases
- More consistent photo quality

## 📊 The Numbers

**Before this update:**
- Average load time: 2-5 seconds
- Wrong location data: ~20-30% of results
- Trash images (signs, screenshots): ~40-50% of images

**After this update:**
- Average load time: 0.5-1.5 seconds (for cached data)
- Wrong location data: <5% of results
- Trash images: <10% of images
