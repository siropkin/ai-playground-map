![Good Playground Map](public/thumbnail_home.png)

**Discover the perfect playground near you with an AI-powered map that transforms basic pins into rich, detailed profiles.**

Good Playground Map isn't just another map app. It's a comprehensive discovery tool that leverages a revolutionary data pipeline:

‚ú® **OpenStreetMap's global playground data** ‚Üí **Google Maps address enrichment** ‚Üí **Perplexity AI-powered playground research** ‚Üí **Detailed, actionable playground profiles**

This intelligent combination of open data and AI automatically researches and presents detailed information about each playground, making your search for the perfect play spot easier and more informed.

## ü§î Why Good Playground Map?

Finding a great playground can be time-consuming. Standard maps might show a pin, but they often lack crucial details: What equipment is there? Is it suitable for toddlers? Is parking available?

Good Playground Map solves this by:
*   **Automating Research:** No more manual searching across multiple websites.
*   **Providing Rich Details:** Get AI-generated summaries, features, and potentially even user-uploaded photos.
*   **Centralizing Information:** Everything you need to know in one place.

## üí° The Magic Behind It: Intelligent Data Enrichment

What makes this app unique is its **intelligent data enrichment pipeline**:

1.  **Discovery**: Pulls playground locations from OpenStreetMap's vast global database.
2.  **Enrichment**: Uses the Google Maps Geocoding API to convert coordinates into precise, detailed addresses.
3.  **AI-Powered Context**: Leverages Perplexity AI to automatically research and generate rich, descriptive information about each playground based on its location and name.

This process transforms simple map markers into comprehensive resources, offering a superior user experience.

## üí∞ Project Costs & Support

To run this project,
I use the Perplexity AI API and Google Maps Geocoding API which cost me some money
(~$0.02 for one playground research) which I pay out of my own pocket.
If you like the project and want it to keep running and improving, please consider supporting me with a coffee!
